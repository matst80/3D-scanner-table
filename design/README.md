## Basic design

The 1.0 rotary board will be as straightforward as we can make it, to allow for reproduction around the world should the project be successful. It will consist of three parts, a base that can be as simple as a plank, sheet of plastic or even a thick paper, a rotating board such as the IKEA SNUDDA and a Board spinner such as a 3d printed holder with a NEMA stepper engine mounted with a LEGO wheel that runs against the edge of the rotating board.

## Base
The base is only to make sure the rotary board and the NEMA holder does not move away from each other.

## Rotating board
We are using the IKEA SNUDDA because we wanted a design that is available around the globe (more or less) but any spinnable table with a round shape should work as long as you can fit it against the wheel. 

## Board spinner
To spin the rotating board, we are using a NEMA stepper engine with a custom 3d printed part that allows us to mount a LEGO wheel against the rotating board. We are using the NEMA stepper engine because it's available around the world due to its common usage in 3d printers, same goes for the LEGO parts even if it's not as familiar in 3d printing;-). The NEMA stepper engine will be fastened with a 3d printed holder with a screw for tightening the pressure of the LEGO wheel against the board.
